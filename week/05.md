## STORYTELLING
![Storytelling](Images/Storytelling.png)
- Stories are an important piece of the fabric that weaves together our collective humanity.
- A story can provide a mirror or a window to someone elseâ€™s lived experience, engendering empathy and a sense of connection.
- Stories are also important stewards of our past and present experiences and can motivate us to envision a better future.

### Examples of storytelling with HUMAN DATA: 
STORIES BEHIND A LINE: FREDERICA FRANGEPANE 
- The Project (http://www.storiesbehindaline.com/)

**Data Visualization Projects by [Matt Korostoff](https://mkorostoff.github.io/)**

Matt is a software developer who proclaims himself waging a "war on [scope insensitivity](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2ftJ38y9SRBCBsCzy/scope-insensitivity)."
- [Incaceration in the United States](https://mkorostoff.github.io/incarceration-in-real-numbers/) Similarly using simple interactions, this data artist forces us to slow down and think about the United State's culture of mass incarceration.
- [How much Money?](https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/) Full of surprises, this visualization takes you on a ride that will question your understanding of wealth, money and poverty.
